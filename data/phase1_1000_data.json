I ordered different gift cards in various dollar amounts, but I kept each gift card style to the amount the same, i.e. the mini-Amazon boxes contained only $50 gift cards. Thank goodness because each box was shrink-wrapped because there was no indication of the dollar amount on the box itself and I was much too lazy to unwrap them to check them all.\n\nBut, if you felt compelled to rip off the shrink-wrap, you can open the box and check because it's not a taped box - it's MAGNETIC!! Yes, the box is held closed by hidden magnetic force, which isn't strong but is strong enough to keep the box closed. Amazing!\n\nI don't know how Amazon makes money off of these clever gift card containers that are shipped, but I'm sure there's some mathematical and habitual wizardry regarding gift cards and spending.\n\nThis is a fun way to make gift card giving more fun.","summary":"Adorable, miniature Amazon box for the gift card.

The sight of the brown Amazon box & the excitement of getting a new delivery? If so, then you are going to LOVE the little gift box that this gift card comes in. I've ordered many of the Amazon tins, & some with the greeting cards, & this is one of my favorites!  It is Super Adorable, & a great way to give a gift card for any Amazon Fan!\n\nThe little brown box is about 4.5\" x 3\" x 1\" tall. The inside comes with a removable brown flap that holds the gift card perfectly.\n\nOpen the flap & it reveals the gift card inside. The top flaps seem like they are magnetic because when you go to reclose they snap back into place. The bottom has a clear window that allows you to see inside. Small print on the back- Amazon Gift cards, made in China. I chose the \"Thank you\" gift card. (see attached pics). This little gift box comes free with the purchase of your gift card. You can reuse it, or swap out the gift card if you choose.\n\nIt arrives with inside an outer box, so it should arrive safe & sound.\n\nWould it make a great gift? Definitely!  Amazon is a great card to give because there are So many choices of what to spend it on. Unlike other gift cards where you are stuck to a particular retailer\/restaurant. etc, this gives you a variety. I like purchasing gift cards in $25 quantities so I can have a quick gift in hand just in case I need a quick or unexpected gift.\n\nRecommended for:  I recommend this for anyone who loves shopping on Amazon. If you or your gift recipient love getting that Amazon brown box delivery, then you will be giddy when you see this adorable box!\n\nIdeas: You can purchase this & swap out the gift cards. So, for example, it doesnt appear they are still offering the thank you card with this box (like when I bought it).  You could purchase one of the other \"thank you\" gift cards (in box, card, etc), & then purchase a one of these mini box ones & swap the 2 cards. Or use 1 of the gift cards for yourself for future purchases.\n\nAt the time I'm writing this review, it appears you can purchase the gift cards in $25-$2000 amounts. There are 2 posts for this particular mini box style with birthday icons & classic white gift card offerings.\n\nLove this little brown box & I will be ordering more. 5 Stars. Happy Shopping! :)","summary":"If you Love Amazon Deliveries & seeing that box arrive at your door","unixReviewTime":1473206400,"vote":28.0,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71WmNNc3NvL._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61BiPOfnX7L._SY88.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61o6wPy2K3L._SY88.jpg"]}

It is my go-to choice for movie theaters in my area.  I go to a lot of movies and I always try to find gift cards at a discount.  Even better, a few months ago, they started accepting AMC Gift Cards on the Fandango iOS App, so I get a discount and pre-ordered tickets for every move I go to (no ticket fee if you are a AMC Stubs member).\n\nObviously gift cards are primarily for gift giving, so that is really the only time you should pay full price for a gift card. When you are buying a gift card for yourself, it is really pointless unless you are getting a decent percentage off. We bought this gift card for ourselves when it was 20% off as a Lightning Deal around Christmas time which is a great price.

The Amazon card makes a great gift & the bonus tin is \"icing on the cake\". ;)  The bonus tin is about 4\" x 4.5\" & one of the cutest ways to give a gift card as a gift. The inside has a removable black lining insert to hold the gift card. The back has a clear window, & says \"Amazon gift cards\" in very small print.  The tin is reusable & can be used to hold other small items or change. Very nice that Amazon offers this adorable tin with their gift cards.\n\nAmazon gift cards make a great gift because the selection of products offered on this website is Huge!  Unlike giving a gift card to a specific store, restaurant, or for a specific item (i.e. movie tickets, waterparks, etc), an Amazon gift card can be used for whatever the receiver wants. That's a huge perk in gift giving. Other recommendations: Buy it to have on hand as a gift. You never know when you'll be invited to a party or have an event come up where you'll need a quick gift.  No more running around store to store. You'll have this gift on hand.  Another idea- purchase it for yourself. Maybe you know you will want to buy something later in the year. Hang onto the gift card, then you can always easily add it to your account, or right into a family or friends account.","summary":"So Adorable!","unixReviewTime":1469232000,"vote":3.0,"image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/71vlxyyN2NL._SY88.jpg"]}

Getting a $50 card for $40 is always cool especially if I normally use it or shop there anyway.  I bought this to use when we go to the movies and getting $10 free more than compensates for the extra 2 dollar charge for each ticket.  I like getting my ticket before going to the theater since it avoids the line of getting a ticket and since so many theaters now have reserved seating, it is almost becoming mandatory.  If you are running late, having your ticket already is a life saver.  The eticket is nice because I often place gift cards in drawers or weird places and have to go find them.

I decided to take the plunge, though, because I had $65 on my Amazon Gift Card balance. My Prime membership had expired, I hoped that I could use my Amazon Gift card balance to renew it, but for whatever reason, it doesn't appear to be possible. I wanted to treat myself, though, so I went ahead and took a chance on this e-gift card for Ulta so I could pick up some skin care and makeup necessities. Very glad that I did, despite the reviews. That being said, there are a few things that I have learned from buying e-gift cards on Amazon, and I hope these tips can help. First, for in-person orders, do not bother having them scan the bar code, it never works - instead, just read the numbers off to them, simple. Second, if you copy and paste the 16 digit card number, you will need to manually remove the spaces or else it won't register (that's how it is with Dominos, anyway). Dumb, I know, but if it isn't working, try removing the spaces just in case. Third, when shopping at Ulta.com you CANNOT use more than one gift card. Why is that a problem? Because to use the ENTIRETY of my Amazon balance, I had to purchase two separate cards in the amounts of $30 and $35. I didn't want any remaining balance lingering as I have no idea when I'll have the extra funds to renew my Prime membership. This was an inconvenience because I had to split my Ulta purchases into two separate orders. Fourth, apparently the recipient needs to have an Amazon membership. If you are gifting a young person who isn't able to make an Amazon account you could always send the gift card to yourself and then send the card number and pin to the recipient. I have purchased E-Gift Cards off of Amazon for the following companies: P.F. Chang's, Domino's, Ulta, Panda Express, and Chipotle, and haven't had any issues with any of them. It just sounds like Amazon customer service isn't very good at helping people troubleshoot technical issues Order was successful, and if you are still reading, I really hope that this review has helped you make a decision regarding whether or not to purchase. If you have the time, it is usually worthwhile to go for the physical card, but these E-Gift cards are still quite convenient if you are in a pinch or have a long-distance recipient.","summary":"7\/5\/17 - It worked for me (and some tips if you are having issues)","unixReviewTime":1499212800,"vote":28.0,"image":null}
